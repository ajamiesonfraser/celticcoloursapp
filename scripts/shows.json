Her voice has been shaped by the Gaelic traditions of her home, and by the years she spent singing the songs of her brothers and sisters, but her voice is set free here, and often euphorically so, in a way previously unheard. Proving eloquent songwriting runs in the family, Rankin takes us to more private places in her lyrics, and this mixture of vulnerability and exhilaration makes for a powerfully compelling record. After more than twenty-five years in the business, A Fine Line suggests that we are only just now getting to know Heather Rankin.

Key members of the acclaimed BBC Transatlantic Sessions, the trio has recently released their second record, giving us all a rare chance to see three of the world’s finest musicians share a stage together. Master of flutes, whistles and uillean pipes McGoldrick is a founding member of Flook and Lunasa, and is a current member of Capercaillie.

An engaging line-up of well-known solo acts—featuring expertly-played fiddle, piano, guitar, mandolin, whistle and banjo—they enjoyed playing together so much that they decided to continue to perform as Còig whenever their busy solo careers allowed. And in one explosive coming together, what was once solo acts on stage has amalgamated into one electrifying super group. With their driving tunes, haunting songs and infectious energy, Còig has proven to be a serious force to be reckoned with on the traditional music scene.

                        "secondary_language_bio": "Còig, one of Atlantic Canada's premiere traditional groups, is an ensemble of East Coast musicians originally forming to promote the Celtic Colours International Festival. In one explosive coming together, what was once solo acts on stage has amalgamated into one electrifying super group, picked as Penguin Eggs magazine’s 2014 #1 New Discovery internationally. With the fiery Celtic style as its musical core, Còig easily shifts between century old tunes of past generations to original and contemporary compositions, featuring the band’s range of over a dozen instruments (vocals, fiddles, piano, guitar, banjo, mandolin, viola, bouzouki, whistles, and more). With driving tunes, haunting songs, and infectious energy, Còig is an unparalleled musical force.\nFiddler Chrissy Crowley, from Margaree, Cape Breton has an impressive list of awards, nominations, and international appearances. Chrissy embraces her Celtic roots and makes them her own, through original compositions coupled with contemporary arrangements of traditional tunes.\nDarren McMullen, from Hardwood Lands, NS, is a highly sought after multi-instrumentalist. Easily switching between guitar, mandolin, whistle and banjo with Còig, this \"Swiss-army knife\" keeps the rhythm sound diverse, and is sure to impress with his lead playing of his various “on-stage weapons”.\nRachel Davis from Baddeck, Cape Breton spends her time switching from international festival stages to small local dances at home. In a genre that sees many performers pushing the envelope and testing new waters, her style of playing traditional tunes in a traditional way is a refreshing reminder of why the Cape Breton fiddle style drives so hard, and is so sought after.\nJason Roach, from Chéticamp, Cape Breton is one of the most impressive piano players you will ever hear. With a style all his own, and an unparalleled intensity on the keys, you'll have to remind yourself that there's other players on the stage.\nWith a combined total of over 30 nominations and awards, each of Còig’s talented musicians have released their own successful solo albums, and have toured both at home and abroad before coming together as this exciting super group. Their much anticipated debut album \"Five\" was released in June, 2014 to rave reviews, and has earned the band the 2014 Canadian Folk Music Award for Traditional Album of the Year, the Music Nova Scotia Award for Traditional/Roots Recording of the Year, and most recently, the 2015 East Coast Music Award for Roots/Traditional Group Recording of the Year.",

When she is home in Nunavut, IVA works in schools and music programs to teach throat singing and facilitate workshops that encourage youth to create and collaborate, and build on their skills and confidence through music, art and identity.",

It also serves as a spot to wind down at the end of the day. Performance is by invitation only and depends upon artist availability on any given night. The performance schedule is not posted in advance. North Shore singer-songwriter Buddy MacDonald hosts the nightly festivities.

Barely out of high school, Garnet Rogers was on the road as a full-time working musician with his older brother Stan. Together they formed what has come to be accepted as one of the most influential acts in North American folk music. Since then, Garnet has established himself as one of the major talents of our time. A charismatic performer and singer, Garnet casts a powerful physical presence with a voice to match. His music, like the man himself, is literate, passionate, highly sensitive, and deeply purposeful. Cinematic in detail, his songs give expression to the unspoken vocabulary of the heart. It is our pleasure to welcome Garnet to Celtic Colours for the first time.",

The fiddler and singer from Baddeck, who learned to play initially from her grandfather and continued with Karen Beaton, Stan Chapman and Kyle MacNeil through her studies at Cape Breton University, was chosen as the 2009 recipient of the Frank \"Big Sampy\" Sampson award, leading to the release of her debut album that year. A founding member of Cape Breton supergroup Coìg, Rachel released her second album, \"Turns\", in April of 2013 and was nominated for a Canadian Folk Music Award. \n\nRachel Davis from Baddeck, Cape Breton spends her time switching from international festival stages to small local dances at home. In a genre that sees many performers pushing the envelope and testing new waters, her style of playing traditional tunes in a traditional way is a refreshing reminder of why the Cape Breton fiddle style drives so hard, and is so sought after.\n\nStrongly influenced by the playing of her grandfather, Clarence Long, Baddeck native Rachel Davis has been a student of the fiddle since she was twelve. She fondly recalls sitting in a corner of her grandfather’s barber shop, squeaking away at tunes under his careful guidance. Those first efforts lead to more teachers (including Karen Beaton, Kyle MacNeil and Stan Chapman) and great progress, as she has developed into a dynamic player with great timing and a great lift to her music. Along with her solo work, Rachel is also in demand to share the stage with people such as singer-songwriters Buddy MacDonald, Carmel Mikol and Donnie Campbell, and has made guest appearances with groups such as The Cottars. Her latest collaboration is with the new Cape Breton powerhouse ensemble Còig, who released their debut album in 2014.",

The fiddler and singer from Baddeck, was chosen as the 2009 recipient of the Frank \"Big Sampie\" Sampson award, leading to the release of her debut album that year. She released her second album, <i>Turns</i>, in 2013 and was nominated for a Canadian Folk Music Award. A dynamic player with great timing and a great lift to her music, Rachel is often called upon to share the stage with singer-songwriters like Buddy MacDonald, Carmel Mikol and Donnie Campbell. Rachel is a founding member of Cape Breton supergroup Coìg, who released their debut album in 2014 and these days she spends her time between international festival stages and small local dances around home. In a genre that sees many performers pushing the envelope and testing new waters, her style of playing traditional tunes in a traditional way is a refreshing reminder of why the Cape Breton fiddle style drives so hard, and is so sought after.",

Kinnon grew up in Mabou, NS, listening to his father Donald Angus (fiddler and composer) and mother (pianist) playing at home as well as playing for dances in the hall across the road. Fiddler and composer Dan R. MacDonald lived behind that hall and frequently visited the Beaton home. Kinnon's good friend, the late John Morris Rankin who was also moved by the same music, also lived nearby.\n\nKinnon has taught workshops at the Celtic Music Center in Judique, NS, at The Ceilidh Trail School of Music in Inverside, Cape Breton, at Fiddle Tunes in Port Townsend, Washington, USA and at Ceòlas in South Uist, Scotland. Kinnon has performed at numerous dances, concerts and festivals throughout Canada, the US, and the UK. He has composed over 700 tunes and published two collection books. Kinnon has appeared on numerous recordings, the first in 1978 Rounder Records released an album titled The Beaton's of Mabou where Donald Angus and Elizabeth were joined by their two sons, Joey (piano) and Kinnon (fiddle). In the eighties Kinnon and his wife Betty released three other recordings, Cape Breton Fiddle 1, Cape Breton Fiddle 2 and Sprig of Ivy which are now available on a compilation CD. A later recording produced by Kinnon was titled Saturday Night Lively where Kinnon and Betty were joined by their daughter Andrea (fiddle) as well as Joey (piano). The next CD, Cape Breton Fiddle and Piano Music from The Beaton Family of Mabou, a Smithsonian Folkways Recording featured Kinnon and his two nephews Rodney MacDonald and Glenn Graham, and Andrea on fiddles and Kinnon's mother Elizabeth, and wife Betty and sister Mary on pianos with dancing by Rodney MacDonald and another daughter Allison. Kinnon's CD called Eoghan Dubh is selections of Kinnon's own compositions.\n\nKinnon is almost always accompanied by his wife Betty, who also comes from a musical family being the sister of the widely known Cape Breton Fiddler, Buddy MacMaster and is the aunt of the widely traveled Natalie MacMaster. For 11 years, Kinnon was also owner/manager of his own Men's Wear Store in Port Hawkesbury, NS. and was the past Executive and Music Director at the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre in Judique, NS.",

Although she has a couple of years of piano training, all her Cape Breton piano playing is done by ear. At 14 years of age, she started playing dances with her brother Buddy MacMaster and has been accompanying fiddlers for dancers ever since. Betty taught at Colaisde na Gàidhlig / the Gaelic College in St. Ann's last summer and has also taught at the Ceilidh Trail School of Music in Inverside Cape Breton, at Fiddle Tunes in Port Townsend in Washington, USA, and Ceolas in South Uist, Scotland. She has played on numerous recordings including the Smithsonian Folkways recording <i>The Beaton Family of Mabou: Cape Breton Fiddle and Piano Music</i> and, most recently, her daughter Andrea's 2016 release <i>Andrea Beaton with Betty and Dave</i>. Betty is most often paired with her husband, fiddler Kinnon Beaton, and the duo is always in demand to play for dances.",

Comunn Féis an Eilein has played a key role in maintaining the culture here, encouraging the community to preserve and promote their Gaelic roots. They host a Celtic Colours concert each year and have been presenting the annual Féis an Eilein since the early 1990s. Sarah MacInnis and Donna-Marie DeWolfe are talented young artists, both from families rooted in the Island’s culture. Cathy Ann MacPhee is one of the best Gaelic singers in the world, and we’re lucky to have her back. And Mabou natives Dawn and Margie Beaton, renowned for their harmonizing fiddles, will drive the tunes home this afternoon. Gather together with these fine performers for an afternoon of traditional and Gaelic influenced music and culture.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/aros-na-mara-lunch-and-learn/\"   target=\"blank\">Àros na Mara: Lunch and Learn</a>",

In the late 1990s, Joël toured extensively with Ashley MacIsaac and Natalie MacMaster. Over the years, Joël has taught Cape Breton style step dancing through workshops across Canada and the United States. Today Joël lives in Sydney with his family and works as a school teacher, but thankfully he still manages to get out and play for concerts and dances in and around Cape Breton.",

Heather Rankin’s voice is certainly\na familiar one as a member of Cape Breton band The Rankins. Multi- instrumentalist and singer Lucy MacNeil is also a familiar voice across Canada and around the world. Her crystalline vocals are immediately identifiable with her family band, the Barra MacNeils. And Irish singer and flute player Nuala Kennedy’s voice is always welcome around these parts. We are thrilled to include Joella Foulds in this concert celebrating Women of Song. Joella’s singing career started back in the 1970s when she moved to Cape Breton and met Rita MacNeil. After recording and touring with Rita for a few years, Joella shifted focus for awhile, but is now back to her first love of singing. Billie Yvette Rogers, a local singer-songwriter, rounds out tonight’s lineup.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/fishcakes-and-fiddles/\"   target=\"blank\">Fishcakes and Fiddles</a>",

Her voice has been shaped by the Gaelic traditions of her home, and by the years she spent singing the songs of her brothers and sisters, but her voice is set free here, and often euphorically so, in a way previously unheard. Proving eloquent songwriting runs in the family, Rankin takes us to more private places in her lyrics, and this mixture of vulnerability and exhilaration makes for a powerfully compelling record. After more than twenty-five years in the business, A Fine Line suggests that we are only just now getting to know Heather Rankin. She has always been known as the youngest of The Rankin Family, but now, as a solo artist, in some ways, she sounds younger, and more timely, than ever.Heather makes her Celtic Colours debut this year.",

Her singing and flute playing springs from the traditional music of Ireland and Scotland, and from the fathomless realms of her own imagination. A consummate performer with a buoyant personality, her music has been described as unique, evocative, and soul-satisfying. Nuala grew up in Dundalk, Co. Louth, on the East coast of Ireland, a musical area steeped in mythology with long historical links to Scotland. The combination of the best influences of the two cultures, Scottish and Irish, is what has made Nuala the artist she is today. Nuala has been performing at Celtic Colours since 2002, first with Fine Friday, then on her own, with the Unusual Suspects of Celtic Colours, the Nuala Kennedy Trio, Oirialla, and the Snowflake Trio. This year, in addition to performing solo, Nuala introduces us to another group, The Alt, featuring a familiar face in John Doyle and, making his Celtic Colours debut, Eamon O’Leary.",

Playing piano and singing came naturally and was encouraged by her parents. Her first professional work as a singer goes back to the mid 1960’s. A University student in the “folk” era, she performed solo and with others musicians in folk clubs and concerts as a way to help pay for her education.\n\nIn 1979, after moving to Cape Breton, she met Rita MacNeil who had recently returned home. Joella began accompanying her on guitar, singing harmonies and they eventually they formed a band. From 1979-1984 she worked with Rita as her backup singer and guitar player, performing in hundreds of shows with her ranging from local pubs to huge festivals and major theatres across Canada. She also backed Rita solo for many women’s concerts and began writing and performing her own songs at these events. By 1984 Joella was performing solo concerts at festivals and local events.\n\nMusical Theatre opportunities included a tribute to Allistair MacGillivray called “Songs for the Mira” in 1984 and the role of Mistress of the Novices in Nunsense in 1985. The following year she co-created and performed two-women music and comedy show called “Broad Assumptions” with Bette MacDonald. In recent months she has returned to the stage in both musicals and theatre productions. In addition to music, Joella held a full time position with CBC Radio as a Broadcast Journalist and host of a daily current affairs show from 1979 to 1994.\n\nFor more than 20 years Joella put her performance career on hold as she worked on the industry side as an event manager and the co-founder of the Celtic Colours International Festival. She is thrilled to be on stage for the first time at Celtic Colours and paying tribute to her dear friend and mentor, Rita MacNeil.",

The mountain itself is a Victoria County landmark overlooking the Great Bras d’Or. It has been an inspiration for local musicians, writers and artists alike, and is considered sacred ground by Cape Breton’s Mi’kmaq people. Boularderie School lies in the shadow of Kelly’s Mountain, and tonight it is the site of a concert in the mythical Irish character’s name. Award-winning traditional singer and bouzouki player Daoirí Farrell from Ireland is new to the Festival and The Narrows, led by Leanne Aucoin, features artists you’ve come to love through the years. They’ll be joined by Donnie Campbell and Jinks O’Neill to round out the night with some Cape Breton standards. It has always been presumed that Kelly would love music, and if that is so, we’re thinking tonight’s lineup just may be Kelly’s dream come true!\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/songs-supper/\"   target=\"blank\">Songs and Supper</a>",

He has performed internationally and has shared the stage with people such as Tommy Makem, Scotland’s Phil Cunningham and the Tannahill Weavers, Ron Hynes, Evans & Dohety and John Allan Cameron. Although essentially a solo performer, Donnie has also worked at concerts and dances with Cape Breton fiddlers like Carl MacKenzie, Buddy MacMaster, Winnie Chafe, Jerry Holland and Kinnon Beaton just to name a few.\n\nDonnie sings songs that matter to him, from love songs to stories of tragedy and good times and memories. His repertoire runs the course of the folk music revival, songs of Cape Breton, the ancient songs of Scotland and Ireland as well as more recent songs that keep the music fresh.",

From the time the Scottish settlers first arrived here, they were shown true kindness by the Mi’kmaq people. Singer Evan Googoo will extend a welcome to visitors from near and far, including IVA, a throat-singer, poet and writer from Nunavut whose melodic mix of throat singing and poetry bridges sounds from both her Inuit and Irish- Cape Breton roots. George Paul, from the Metepenagiag First Nation in New Brunswick, may be best known for creating the “Mi’kmaq Honour Song”, but he’s been involved in reviving Mi’kmaq songs, chants and ceremonies for more than 30 years. And we’ll get our first taste of Scottish trio Talisk’s energetic and dynamic sound.\n\nNearby Meals: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/potluck-supper/\"   target=\"blank\">Potluck Supper</a>  in Whycocomagh and<a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/soul-food-supper/\"   target=\"blank\">Soul Food Supper</a> in the same building as the evening concert.",

From touring with the likes of Bob Dylan, Mark Knopfler\nand Joan Baez to being founding or long-time members of legendary groups Flook, Lunasa, Battlefield Band and Solas, these three lads have been at the forefront of trad music’s evolution, and play key roles in the BBC Transatlantic Sessions series. Another regular collaborator to that acclaimed series is Phil Cunningham who returns with Ùr: The Future of our Past. Virtuoso Cape Breton fiddler Dwayne Côté will share some tunes, and the Men of the Deeps, North America’s only coal miners chorus, will share some of their many songs and stories. The night wouldn’t be complete without some dancing. The award-winning MacArthur Dancers, no strangers to the 90-year-old Savoy stage, will show us some steps to make it just so.",

It also serves as a spot to wind down at the end of the day. Performance is by invitation only and depends upon artist availability on any given night. The performance schedule is not posted in advance. North Shore singer-songwriter Buddy MacDonald hosts the nightly festivities.

This year’s concert takes a long look back at the tradition behind the pipes, and how that tradition is being studied, absorbed and brought into the future. Seudan features four vibrant young Highland bagpipers, anchored by the traditional piper and Gaelic singer Allan MacDonald, who comes from a well-revered piping family. They offer lively pipe music, rooted in the step dancing traditions long lost to Scotland, but that continue to this day on Cape Breton. Nuallan, a group of local pipers formed by Colaisde Na Gàidhlig, have dedicated themselves to representing, promoting and exploring the dance style of piping brought from Scotland by Highland Gaels and developed here over the past two hundred years. In recognition of the ties between the piping traditions of Scotland and Cape Breton Island, pipes made by celebrated craftsman Hamish Moore will be presented to the Gaelic College during this concert.

For 20 years La Swing du Suête dance troupe, comprised of students at L’École NDA in Chéticamp, has been promoting and presenting Acadian Cape Breton dance here at home and across the Maritimes, in Quebec, Alberta and Louisiana. Christine Doucette is Artistic Director and handles choreography along with Sylvie Doucette, both former dancers with the troupe. Bon Débarras will bring their energetic music and dance from Quebec to this afternoon’s celebration. And Andrea, Véronique, Douglas and Lawrence, all well- versed in the Acadian and Québécois dance traditions, will provide the tunes and tempos needed for these dancers to show their steps",

The group brings together a fusion of Quebecois folk music, traditional step dancing and global influences, for a show that is full of fun and inventive energy. On guitar, banjo, violin and harmonica, the trio opens a door to their recollections of America and their music is at the intersection of various traditions. Bon Débarras’ energy taps into the rhythms of today and ventures boldly on the multi-faceted road to tomorrow’s dreams, in an atmosphere that transcends boundaries and ages.",

Born and raised in the northern Inverness County community of Belle Côte with paternal roots just down the road from Margaree and Mabou, he has played piano in concerts since the age of five, and fiddle since he was nine. Douglas is a veteran of Celtic Colours and many of the larger square dances in Cape Breton. He released his first CD in 2010.

The Fortress, North America’s largest historical reconstruction, offers a glimpse of life in colonial Cape Breton around the 1740s. If you are fortunate enough to get a ticket to this perennially\nsold out show, you are in for a real treat. The evening begins with an authentic, traditional 18th century meal, served in period costume and character by candlelight. An after- dinner walk, guided by the glow of lanterns through the cobbled streets, takes you to the lovely chapel in the King’s Bastion for a night of acoustic songs and tunes from Cape Breton, Acadian, and Irish traditions. Nicole LeBlanc is a singer and songwriter who mixes traditional Acadian songs with her own compositions, making the connection between past and present. The Cormier Duo plays both local traditional and age-old classical tunes on guitar while Ireland’s Fergal Scahill and Ryan Molloy will contribute some fiddle tunes to this unique experience.",

Elle participe à diverses activités musicales depuis sa jeunesse et a profité de ses années au Conseil des arts de Chéticamp afin de faire vivre sa passion, la musique. Après ses années à l'École NDA, elle s'est rendue à l'Université de Moncton où elle a étudié l'éducation musicale. Aujourd'hui, elle enseigne la musique dans la même école où elle a grandi. Elle veut partager sa passion avec les autres, jeunes et moins jeunes, que ce soit à l'école, à l'église, dans un party de cuisine ou sur la scène. Elle est directrice artistique de divers spectacles communautaires ainsi que de la troupe de danse, la Swing du Suête. Elle a participé a quelques productions spéciales, telles que le Grand Cercle, la Soirée chez Gélas, le 40e anniversaire de la FANE, etc. Elle compose depuis quelques années et fait des spectacles à l'année longue, mais surtout durant la saison estivale. Influencée du style traditionnel acadien, Nicole veut faire vivre la culture aux gens qu'elle rencontre. Elle croit en ce que ses ancêtres lui ont laissé ; une culture remplie de belles traditions et de la musique qui dit beaucoup. \"La musique est le lien le plus étroit entre moi et ceux qui sont venus avant moi.\"",

Most of these settlers were from Barra and some say you can still hear a touch of the Barra accent in the local Gaelic. Community gatherings tend to happen at the Fire Hall these days, where dances and concerts are held year-round. Renowned Gaelic singer Cathy Ann MacPhee was born and raised on Barra, so she should feel right at home here tonight, accompanied by Patsy Seddon on harp. Piano player Maybelle Chisholm McQueen is a local legend, who, with fiddler Colin Grant and guitar-player Brian Doyle, will offer up some good old Cape Breton tunes, and PEI’s Ten Strings and a Goat Skin make their Festival debut as we celebrate 15 years of Raising the Roof in Boisdale.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/local-harvest-thanksgiving-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">Local Harvest Thanksgiving Dinner</a>",

Seeing this trio is a rare treasure and it has taken years for us to get them here. Be sure to catch them tonight in their last gig of the Festival. This is also Cape Breton supergroup Còig’s last night at the Festival. Featuring Rachel Davis and Chrissy Crowley on fiddles, Jason Roach on piano, and Darren McMullen on just about everything else, these are four of the finest players on the scene today.\nBut it’s not all about tunes and good-byes tonight. Canadian folk music legend Garnet Rogers and Margaree born singer-songwriter Lisa Cameron will add some well-chosen, melodically-inclined words to this evening’s gathering at the head of the waters.\n\nNearby Meal: Soul Food Supper",

Barely out of high school, Garnet Rogers was on the road as a full-time working musician with his older brother Stan. Together they formed what has come to be accepted as one of the most influential acts in North American folk music. Since then, Garnet has established himself as one of the major talents of our time. A charismatic performer and singer, Garnet casts a powerful physical presence with a voice to match. His music, like the man himself, is literate, passionate, highly sensitive, and deeply purposeful. Cinematic in detail, his songs give expression to the unspoken vocabulary of the heart. It is our pleasure to welcome Garnet to Celtic Colours for the first time.",

With the fiery Celtic style as its musical core, Còig easily shifts between century old tunes of past generations to original and contemporary compositions, featuring the band’s range of over a dozen instruments (vocals, fiddles, piano, guitar, banjo, mandolin, viola, bouzouki, whistles, and more). With driving tunes, haunting songs, and infectious energy, Còig is an unparalleled musical force.\nFiddler Chrissy Crowley, from Margaree, Cape Breton has an impressive list of awards, nominations, and international appearances. Chrissy embraces her Celtic roots and makes them her own, through original compositions coupled with contemporary arrangements of traditional tunes.\nDarren McMullen, from Hardwood Lands, NS, is a highly sought after multi-instrumentalist. Easily switching between guitar, mandolin, whistle and banjo with Còig, this \"Swiss-army knife\" keeps the rhythm sound diverse, and is sure to impress with his lead playing of his various “on-stage weapons”.\nRachel Davis from Baddeck, Cape Breton spends her time switching from international festival stages to small local dances at home. In a genre that sees many performers pushing the envelope and testing new waters, her style of playing traditional tunes in a traditional way is a refreshing reminder of why the Cape Breton fiddle style drives so hard, and is so sought after.\nJason Roach, from Chéticamp, Cape Breton is one of the most impressive piano players you will ever hear. With a style all his own, and an unparalleled intensity on the keys, you'll have to remind yourself that there's other players on the stage.\nWith a combined total of over 30 nominations and awards, each of Còig’s talented musicians have released their own successful solo albums, and have toured both at home and abroad before coming together as this exciting super group. Their much anticipated debut album \"Five\" was released in June, 2014 to rave reviews, and has earned the band the 2014 Canadian Folk Music Award for Traditional Album of the Year, the Music Nova Scotia Award for Traditional/Roots Recording of the Year, and most recently, the 2015 East Coast Music Award for Roots/Traditional Group Recording of the Year.",

An engaging line-up of well-known solo acts—featuring expertly-played fiddle, piano, guitar, mandolin, whistle and banjo—they enjoyed playing together so much that they decided to continue to perform as Còig whenever their busy solo careers allowed. And in one explosive coming together, what was once solo acts on stage has amalgamated into one electrifying super group. With their driving tunes, haunting songs and infectious energy, Còig has proven to be a serious force to be reckoned with on the traditional music scene.

You can bet there will be plenty of “craic” on the go at the Cabaret with this amazing lineup of singers, dancers and players from Cape Breton, Scotland, Ireland, and Newfoundland. Phil Cunningham and Ùr: The Future of our Past were so much fun last year that we just had to have them back. As anyone who has had the pleasure knows, Phil tends to encourage a party atmosphere wherever he plays, seemingly just by being there. With the energetic and dynamic playing of award-winning Scottish trio Talisk, The Narrows’ repertoire of music from Cape Breton and Newfoundland, and some songs from bouzouki, guitar and banjo- playing Irish singer Daoirí Farrell, along with dancing by the Forrester Dancers, you might just be jumping up for a jig yourself!\n\n19 & Over.

It also serves as a spot to wind down at the end of the day. Performance is by invitation only and depends upon artist availability on any given night. The performance schedule is not posted in advance. North Shore singer-songwriter Buddy MacDonald hosts the nightly festivities. Tickets are half price for those holding a ticket stub from a Celtic Colours performance that day.\n<b>*Restricted to 19 years and over. Picture ID required.</b>",

The Mi’kmaw culture is deeply rooted here, with strong ties to Cape Breton Gaelic and Acadian traditions, including a shared love of music, dance and poetic expression. Fiddler Chrissy Crowley, who comes from a long line of respected Cape Breton-Scottish fiddlers, and piano player Jason Roach, from the Acadian community of Chéticamp, represent these close ties. IVA, a throat-singer and poet from Nunavut, has Cape Breton-Irish roots and will be performing with her five-piece band. New Brunswick singer-songwriter George Paul has been involved in reviving Mi’kmaq songs, chants and ceremonies for over thirty years. And we round out today’s gathering with the Denny Family Dancers, at the venue named for the founder of the local group, Sarah Denny.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/thanksgiving-dinner-by-the-bras-dor/\"   target=\"blank\">Thanksgiving Dinner by the Bras d’Or</a>",

Influenced by her grandmother, Sarah learned and embraced many Mi’kmaq chants, dances, crafts and medicines. As popularity of the re-emergence of the Mi’kmaq culture increased, the group became more popular and started performing outside of the province. Viewed within their own community as being the heart of Mi’kmaq culture in song and dance, the group has released an album of songs and chants, been featured in a number of films, participated in elders and youth conferences held in the Atlantic Provinces and continue to play a major part in supporting powwows in the Maritimes.

Home to Buddy MacMaster and Judique on the Floor days, this community is the perfect place to celebrate this instrument we love so much. Fiddle styles we’ll see tonight include east and west coast Cape Breton, Antigonish County, Downeast, Irish, Scottish and more. Howie has relatives along this coast and will feel right at home, and Troy, Shane and Kimberley will reconnect from their touring lives. Phil with his students and “tune-a-day” Fergal will add to tonight’s stellar lineup. Of course, this being Cape Breton, there’ll be some great dancing too.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/seafood-choices-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">Seafood Choices Dinner</a>",

And tonight the tunes will be flowing in the beautiful St. Matthew Wesley Church. The legendary Brenda Stubbert, who calls North Sydney home, will be joined by Paul MacDonald on guitar and Doug MacPhee on piano, well-known musicians in their own right. Good friends and contemporaries from up the road, Paul Cranford and Sarah Beck will present tunes on stage much like Paul has done with his many tune books. Garnet Rogers is joining us from Ontario, and like his late brother Stan, is an accomplished singer-songwriter. And Scotland’s Talisk will edge up the tempo and the volume. This award-winning trio will find themselves right at home and in good company tonight on the Northside.",

Barely out of high school, Garnet Rogers was on the road as a full-time working musician with his older brother Stan. Together they formed what has come to be accepted as one of the most influential acts in North American folk music. Since then, Garnet has established himself as one of the major talents of our time. A charismatic performer and singer, Garnet casts a powerful physical presence with a voice to match. His music, like the man himself, is literate, passionate, highly sensitive, and deeply purposeful. Cinematic in detail, his songs give expression to the unspoken vocabulary of the heart. It is our pleasure to welcome Garnet to Celtic Colours for the first time.",

On this Thanksgiving Monday, we’ll travel down the road to D’Escousse, a lovely Acadian village on Isle Madame, to celebrate our Canadian and Cape Breton French roots with some Acadian and Québécois music and dance. Bon Débarras, a trio from Montréal, will bring their fun and energetic fusion of Québecois folk music and traditional step dancing. Cape Breton singer-songwriter Cyril MacPhee’s Acadian roots are on his mother’s side, and he will showcase both his own songs and songs from the Island. Décota McNamara, from just up the road in Richmond County, will also share some songs with us tonight. And Leanne Aucoin’s new band The Narrows will certainly pull from their Acadian, Chéticamp and Quebec influences with fiddle at the forefront.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/turkey-dinner-in-arichat/\"   target=\"blank\">Turkey Dinner in Arichat</a>",

Over the past 20 years, Cyril has performed for audiences throughout Canada, the USA and in Scotland and Ireland and shared the stage with artists such as The Rankins, Natalie MacMaster, Bruce Guthro, Ashley MacIsaac, Gordie Sampson, J.P. Cormier, Buddy MacDonald, Dave Gunning to name a few. A past Artist in Residence, Cyril has released five albums, three with the popular power-folk group Brakin' Tradition and two as a solo artist. He was also featured on the 2016 compilation, <i>Celtic Colours Live - Volume 4</i>, performing Buddy MacDonald's song \"We Remember You Well\" with legendary Scottish singer Archie Fisher.",

Tonight’s Cabaret offers all that and more with a little something for everyone. Nuala Kennedy, Eamon O’Leary and John Doyle form The Alt and have travelled from all corners of the world to be here tonight to share their Irish ballads, tunes, and songs. Prince Edward Island’s Ten Strings and a Goat Skin, whose traditional and original music infused with pop and world rhythms earned them a Juno nomination earlier this year, will surely have your toes tapping. Cape Breton singer-songwriter Jordan Musycsyn’s folk-country style and engaging songs will move you from laughter to tears and back again. And Jennifer Roland—fiddler, dancer, and teacher of both—will bring along her full band to lay it all down. There are sure to be a few magic moments and memories made at this Celtic Cabaret tonight.\n\n19 & Over. Photo ID Required",

The Alt are fully aware of this history, and recorded their debut album in the quiet isolation of a small cabin in North Carolina’s Appalachian mountains.

As we mark the second year of partnering with the Bell Museum to host a concert in this unique space, we’ll toast the man himself the best way we know how - with music he would surely love. Tonight we’ll hear from three pairs of delightful duos who’ll share Gaelic songs, impressive playing and a little bit of dancing. Coming from Bell’s birthplace of Scotland, Gaelic singer Cathy Ann MacPhee is back to delight with her traditional songs and witty banter. She’ll be joined by harp player Patsy Seddon. Son and father duo Maxim and Gervais hail from Chéticamp. Their intricate finger picking style on guitar will have your eyes glued to those frets. And duo Andrea Beaton from Inverness County, with fiddling friend Véronique Plasse from Quebec, are the perfect package bringing fiddle, vocals and steps. Bell would be delighted.",

It also serves as a spot to wind down at the end of the day. Performance is by invitation only and depends upon artist availability on any given night.

With this mind, we knew Calvin United Church would be the perfect place to feature this afternoon’s jovial artists. Brothers Kyle and Sheumas MacNeil, of the Barra MacNeils, are traditional culture bearers. While usually quite busy touring with the band, they ensure that their time home is spent passing down their knowledge and mentoring young up-and-coming musicians. Doug MacPhee calls New Waterford home, and he’ll rattle the keys on the beautiful upright piano today. As Ireland’s song revivalist trio The Alt, Nuala, Eamon and John will carefully weave a mosaic of ballads and melodies. More melodies and harmonies will ring loud and clear as the all-female choir, The Breton Songbirds, take to the choir loft. Sit back and take in the delightful sounds and beautiful stained-glass sights.",

Every performer on this stage can say they started dancing at a very young age, including Rodney MacDonald. From just a stone’s throw away, Rodney welcomes fellow dancers Bill and John Pellerin of Antigonish to shine up their shoes for the night. Not to be outdone, dance troupe Fileanta will perform dance and square sets from the area. Matched up with traditional pipe group Nuallan, it’s a perfect marriage. And why stop at only three pipers when we can have five more, courtesy of Seudan. That adds up to a piper for every dancer! We’ll also get to see the Québécois steps of Bon Débarras, highland by Marielle, and those of dance troup Sgiobalta.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/port-hood-roast-beef-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">Port Hood Roast Beef Dinner</a>",

The seemingly effortless transitions, tuneful operation, and rhythmic expression heard in spoken Gaelic can be attributed to the rhythms and fluid motion observable in stepdancing.\n\nOur mission is to foster the living dance traditions of Gaelic Nova Scotia, by promoting an avenue for new-generation, youth and professional dance artists to share their vision, create, and collaborate with musicians and engage with communities and organizations.",

The group brings together a fusion of Quebecois folk music, traditional step dancing and global influences, for a show that is full of fun and inventive energy. On guitar, banjo, violin and harmonica, the trio opens a door to their recollections of America and their music is at the intersection of various traditions.

Soirées are hosted throughout the year in this community, and with Celtic Colours here, throughout the week as well, including this evening at La Place des arts Père Anselme Chiasson. Sylvia makes Chéticamp her home. Her voice is like no other and you will be soothed by her mesmerizing lyrics. Danelle and Celine are twins with parental ties to this community. Taught by Wendy MacIsaac, they’ve returned to Chéticamp for many Conseil des Arts productions over the years. Leanne Aucoin’s roots are in Chéticamp and her band The Narrows blends the Scottish-Acadian and Québécois sounds perfectly. With Acadian connections across the way in PEI, Ten Strings and a Goat Skin put a bow on the evening, connecting with interprovincial Acadian cousins.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/acadian-culinary-experience/\"   target=\"blank\">Acadian Culinary Experience</a>",

They sang French traditional songs and Bourgeois’ compositions. \n\nSince 1989, Sylvia’s been writing some of her own compositions and performing as a solo artist, accompanied by her brothers or other local musicians, playing most summers at the outdoor concerts at Cape Breton Highlands National Park. She also promotes French and Cape Breton culture by singing for bus tours. \n\nIn 1993, Sylvia’s song “J t’appartiens” won first prize in Societe Radio Canada’s Le Gala de la Chanson de la Nouvelle Ecosse. As a result, she recorded two songs for French radio and the response encouraged her to put together a full length CD. With the help of the local radio station CKJM, Sylvia recorded <i>Avec Amitié</i> in 1997, composed of eight original and four traditional French songs. In 1998, the CD won the Gonzaque prize given by Le Conseil Culturel de la Nouvelle Ecosse in recognition of quality Acadien work.

Blazing Newfoundland singles, quirky Quebec reels and driving Cape Breton jigs are all played from the heart, with a healthy dose of tunes from the musical motherlands of Ireland and Scotland thrown in for good measure. Leanne Aucoin (fiddle, piano, step dance) is steeped in the rich musical culture of Cape Breton where she learned her music from family members and mentors growing up in Sydney Mines. Colin Carrigan is one of the finest younger generation Newfoundland fiddle players, whose unique repertoire and lively style echo the vibrant musical culture of his home province. Jon Goodman, on uilleann pipes and wooden flute, is a sought-after Irish session player in Halifax, who has recorded and performed with East Coast musicians from Rita MacNeil to Joel Plaskett. Coming from a musical family in Weymouth, NS, singer and guitarist Jesse Lewis grew up playing in rock bands before turning his attention to accompanying fiddle players, with a style influenced by Cape Breton-style piano accompaniment. And originally from Quebec’s Eastern Townships, Roy MacLaren completes the lineup on tin whistles, tenor banjo, and his first instrument, highland bagpipes.",

In this case though, we’re talking about taking to Talisk, and in that context, having to face the music is nothing but pure pleasure. Talisk is an award- winning trio based in Scotland who have been turning heads since they got together three years ago. We can’t wait for you to hear them and once you do, we’re sure you’ll be taking to Talisk, too. Also on stage tonight will be fiddler Fergal Scahill with Ryan Molloy on piano and dancer Emma O’Sullivan. You may recognize Fergal from previous visits with We Banjo 3. This time around, the beautiful Irish lilt in his playing will be centre stage. Cape Breton, Scottish, and Irish roots are well-represented in this concert, which also features tunes from Mckayla and Kevin, and songs from Adrianne and Mike Gorey.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/traditional-irish-stew-supper/\"   target=\"blank\">Traditional Irish Stew Supper</a>",

Her extraordinary drive and determination in mastering her art has seen her eclipse all other sean-nós dancers with her creative, exciting, and masterful footwork. Emma’s dancing has been described as a breath of fresh air and an experience to be relished.  She has made numerous television and radio appearances both in Ireland and abroad and performed with some of the most influential acts in traditional Irish dance music including Sharon Shannon, Lunasa, Teada, Dervish, Dedannan, Altan, Cherish the Ladies, and Seamus Begley.

Borrowing on the idea of the Burns House song creation project in Scotland, we’re making this a completely Canadian endeavor in light of Canada’s big 150th birthday. Artist in Residence James Keelaghan, Cape Breton native Bruce Guthro, Prince Edward Island darling Catherine MacLellan, Ontario’s Lynn Miles, and JD Edwards and Cara Luft of The Small Glories, from Manitoba have been at it night and day all week, sequestered in the Song House writing original songs inspired by each other’s roots, the places they they call home, and the places they’ve travelled in this great country of ours. Tonight they emerge to share their favourites with us. It promises to be a special and intimate evening for lovers of song everywhere.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/seafood-chowder-at-the-dobson/\"   target=\"blank\">Seafood Chowder at the Dobson</a>",

He has released 12 albums, including a 25-year retrospective, and regularly tours North America, Europe, the UK, and Australia. James has an uncanny knack for finding incredible stories and turning them into finely crafted songs. A commanding performer, he develops an intimate rapport with audiences through his stories and sense of humour, and then leaves them spellbound with passionate renditions of songs that touch on universal emotions and relate historical events to the present. This will be James’ fourth time at Celtic Colours and we are excited to welcome him back as one of this year’s Artists in Residence. One of his responsibilities in this role will be to lead a weeklong songwriting session collaborating with writers from across Canada, the results of which will be presented in the concert Songs from Scratch during the Festival.",

A self-professed “study in contrasts,” Luft's folkie yin proves a perfect match for Edwards’ rocker yang. Thrown together purely by accident, The Small Glories is a partnership that could almost make you believe in fate.   Straight out of the gate these two veteran singer/songwriters built a buzz around their tight harmonies, authenticity, visceral live performances and equally well-matched guitar prowess. Luft packs a mean banjo as well. Their 2016 debut album <i>Wondrous Traveler</i> is steeped in classic song structure, delivering instantly appealing melodic Americana with first-rate playing. The album found its way onto many critic’s Top 10 lists across North America and Europe, and The Small Glories are finding themselves on stages from Vancouver to London and beyond. Together, Luft and Edwards are a musical tour de force.",

Thrown together purely by accident, The Small Glories is a partnership that could almost make you believe in fate.   Straight out of the gate these two veteran singer/songwriters built a buzz around their tight harmonies, authenticity, visceral live performances and equally well-matched guitar prowess. Luft packs a mean banjo as well. Their 2016 debut album <i>Wondrous Traveler</i> is steeped in classic song structure, delivering instantly appealing melodic Americana with first-rate playing. The album found its way onto many critic’s Top 10 lists across North America and Europe, and The Small Glories are finding themselves on stages from Vancouver to London and beyond. Together, Luft and Edwards are a musical tour de force.",

She's worked diligently at her craft, releasing a series of remarkable, creative albums, culminating in the Juno Award-winning <i>The Raven's Sun</i> (2014). Most impressively, she has chosen to carve out her career path without trading on her family name. That's pretty hard to do when your father is one of the country's most famous songwriters. Gene MacLellan wrote two world-wide, multi-million selling smash hits--\"Snowbird\" (Anne Murray), and \"Put Your Hand in the Hand\" (Ocean)--plus dozens more gems. Now MacLellan has gone from shying away from those songs to fully embracing them, with a stunning new album celebrating her father's musical legacy. <i>If It's Alright With You: The Songs of Gene MacLellan</i> contains 13 of her father's most famous compositions and features two generations of Juno Award-winning artists. With her grace and charm, Catherine MacLellan has captivated audiences since her 2004 solo debut. Her ability to make deep emotional connections with her intimate lyrics, or to keep things easy-going and light-hearted, will be of great benefit to her collaborators in the Songs from Scratch project.",

You’ll be glad you came, not only for the hospitality, but for the amazing set of artists performing this evening as well. Hailing from the US, Alison Brown is a virtuoso on the banjo, with an Appalachian style that is sure to please. Troy, Shane and Ray join us from across Canada with a slew of instruments and tunes that will have folks on their feet. Cape Breton’s own Kimberley Fraser, a former Artist in Residence and no stranger to Celtic Colours, will show us why she is a sought out fiddler and instructor of her craft. And Paul McKenna will join us from Scotland. With his busy touring schedule we’re glad he could join us this year, bringing his amazing vocals and instrumentation. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to enjoy this great show and the genuine hospitality you’ll receive in Port Morien.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/traditional-salt-cod-supper/\"   target=\"blank\">Traditional Salt Cod Supper</a>",

Acclaimed as one of today’s finest progressive banjo players, you rarely find Alison in a conventional bluegrass setting. Instead, she’s known for leading an ensemble that successfully marries a broad array of roots-influenced music including Folk, Jazz, Celtic and Latin. Although banjos typically play “tunes” or “breakdowns,” in Alison Brown’s hands, the banjo truly sings. Brown never wastes a note. Rather than launching into banjo tsunamis, just because she can, Alison stops her precision three-finger roll to leave space for a lyric or other instrumental voice when appropriate. Don’t mistake it, there is plenty of jaw-dropping virtuosity in her playing, but it's always in service to the melody at hand. Brown always plays the words as well as the melody. Also a guitarist, composer, and producer who has won and has been nominated for several Grammy awards, we are excited to welcome Alison and her band back to Celtic Colours.",

It also serves as a spot to wind down at the end of the day. Performance is by invitation only and depends upon artist availability on any given night. The performance schedule is not posted in advance. North Shore singer-songwriter Buddy MacDonald hosts the nightly festivities.

The North River Community Hall is just the place for such an occasion. Festival Club host, and one of this year’s Artists in Residence Buddy MacDonald, is originally from the nearby North Shore. He will make a rare daytime appearance this afternoon to welcome fellow Artist in Residence James Keelaghan, and singers Darrell Keigan and Nipper MacLeod. The North River hall is a small one, providing a very intimate setting for a very special concert. Songs and stories go hand in hand, whether it’s the story about how a song was written, or something that happened when a song was sung. Everybody has a story to tell, but it’s a rare gift to be able to spin those stories into song. The guys on stage today know that first-hand and share a mutual respect for each other, and for the craft of singing and writing songs as well.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/englishtown-luncheon/\"   target=\"blank\">Englishtown Luncheon</a>",

He was exposed at an early age to the singing and storytelling of some of the great singers of his native Island. Much of his songwriting is still influenced by this style that he was so familiar with as a young boy on the North Shore, and his songs have been performed and recorded by artists around the world. Buddy has entertained audiences throughout Canada, the United States, Germany, Scotland and the Scandinavian countries, performing as a solo act and in different combinations with other musicians from Cape Breton including Natalie MacMaster, Howie MacDonald, Ashley MacIsaac, Dave MacIsaac, and John Allan Cameron among many others. Since Celtic Colours started in 1997, Buddy has been the host of the late night Festival Club, and has performed all over the Island with musicians from all over the world including Scotland's Dougie MacLean and Archie Fisher, and Ireland's Tommy Makem and Michael Black. Whether in a small country hall, pub, festival or concert theatre, Buddy's love of writing, singing and entertaining comes across to bridge the gap between performer and listener.",

He was very protective of these tunes, believing they came to him from deceased players and so only a handful have ever been reproduced in print. Tonight we will unveil just a few of his compositions in a special show comprised mainly of fellow Cape Breton musicians who have played with John or are directly connected to him. A small selection of tunes from the vault will be performed tonight on fiddle, pipes, guitar, piano and more.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/annual-salmon-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">Annual Salmon Dinner</a>",

He captured this style of playing live on his recordings <i>From Foot Cape</i> (2003) and <i>Before You Arrived</i> (2005). As well as being a player in high demand who has performed throughout Canada, the Eastern United States and Scotland, Ian has become a great teacher in his own right.

One of his myriad gifts is to make pibroch accessible and lovable. His work as a scholar-performer reuniting seventeenth-century piping with its Gaelic roots is influencing a whole generation of pipers. No stranger to Cape Breton and Celtic Colours, Allan has played the Festival many times in the past, from the early days with Margaret Stewart to performances on his own and with his brothers Iain and Dr. Angus, and with the Scottish piping group Seudan. This year he returns with Seudan and will also play a number or two from John MacDougall's Tunebook, in tribute to the prolific Cape Breton composer.",

Although his earlier lessons on the fiddle came from his father, uncle, and aunt, Kyle developed his craft for the “old style” under the tutelage of John MacDougall. He acknowledges John as the one who drove certain little nuances into his playing, such as the use of his fourth finger instead of using open notes.

The seemingly counter-intuitive term is left over from the days of sailing ships when vessels were carried north by the winds of the Gulf Stream. These days we travel mostly by road, and a trip down north will take you along the Cabot Trail. Whether on the clock-wise route north from Chéticamp, or coming through the Ingonish area on the east side of the Island, you will be rewarded with magnificent views of the Highlands and the rocky shore below. And as if the drive wasn’t enough, once you arrive at Aspy Bay, you’re in for a real treat of French and English songs from Quebec and the Prairies and many fiddle styles including Cape Breton, Acadian, Irish, Scottish, French- Canadian, Canadian old-time, and Bluegrass. There’s a little something for everyone Way Up Down North.\n\nNearby Meals: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/top-of-the-island-traditional-seafood-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">Top of the Island Seafood Dinner </a> and <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/lobster-crab-supper/\"   target=\"blank\">Lobster & Crab Supper</a>",

Straight out of the gate these two veteran singer/songwriters built a buzz around their tight harmonies, authenticity, visceral live performances and equally well-matched guitar prowess. Luft packs a mean banjo as well. Their 2016 debut album <i>Wondrous Traveler</i> is steeped in classic song structure, delivering instantly appealing melodic Americana with first-rate playing. The album found its way onto many critic’s Top 10 lists across North America and Europe, and The Small Glories are finding themselves on stages from Vancouver to London and beyond.

They have combined Calum’s Hebridean roots and distinctive Cape Breton piano style with Alexis’ harmonization of Irish, Scottish, and Cape Breton sounds on the fiddle. Through the spirit of their respective approaches to music, they have created a clean and seamless sound that is grounded in tradition. Their debut album, <i>The Bay Street Sessions</i>, is a compilation of original and traditional compositions and arrangements, infused with centuries-old feeling and contemporary flair; their mutual love for music articulated in each note and phrase from bow to key. The duo is joined by John Dahms, a Canadian-based fiddler with a serious commitment to traditional Irish music; and Paul Hawtin, a mostly self-taught guitar-player whose appreciation for early rock & roll and funk took a back seat to traditional music after being exposed to the Irish session scene in early '90s Vancouver.",

When you arrive, you’ll find a scenic town, heavy with salty sea air. As you’re welcomed into the town’s Playhouse, and greeted by gracious staff, you’ll find yourself in one of our most unique and intimate venues. The Louisbourg Playhouse is the next best thing to a house ceilidh that we can offer, and we promise your kitchen never sounded this good. Roger Stone has become known as a masterful songwriter, and a pretty fine guitar and banjo picker, too. Hanneke Cassel’s musical influences and fiddle-playing have taken her to many corners of the globe. Her compositions and virtuosic playing will give us a taste of some of those travels. Five-piece powerhouse trad band Ímar represents a bit of\na crossroads all on its own, pulling Scottish, Irish, Manx and English influences into their sound. Their wit, charm and clean, pitch perfect tunes will bring a smile to your face. We promise.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/louisbourg-roast-beef-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">Louisbourg Roast Beef Dinner </a>",

With a line-up featuring members of Mànran, RURA, Talisk and Barrule, and a heavyweight collective haul of top prizes – including the 2016 BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician of the Year, a BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award, nine All-Ireland and eight All-Britain titles – the group’s formation embodies a personal reconnection with its members’ formative years, dating back long before their recent camaraderie around Glasgow’s justly celebrated session scene. Adam Brown (bodhrán), Adam Rhodes (bouzouki), Mohsen Amini (concertina), Ryan Murphy (uilleann pipes) and Tomás Callister (fiddle) share a strong background in Irish music – although only Murphy actually hails from Ireland; Rhodes and Callister are from the Isle of Man, whilst Amini is a Glasgow native, and Brown originally from Suffolk – and it is these foundations which underpin many of Ímar’s distinctive qualities, in both instrumentation and material. Ímar’s unmistakable synergy, however, centres on the overlapping cultural heritage between Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. All three places once shared the same Gaelic language, and a similar, clearly potent, kinship endures between their musical traditions.",

Hanneke’s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional. A native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community—both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser’s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp, Harald Haugaard’s International Fiddle School, and the Boston Harbor Scottish Fiddle School. She has served as a guest instructor in the American Roots department at Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor of Music in Violin Performance. The Hanneke Cassel Trio features Mike Block on cello and guitarist Keith Murphy. Fusing influences from the Isle of Skye and Cape Breton with Americana grooves and musical innovations, this group creates a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition.",

        "description_public": "Tonight’s Concert by the Canal in St. Peter’s offers an exciting mix of tradition and inspiration with tunes on fiddle and guitar, some uncommon banjo playing, songs from the Irish tradition, and step dancers from just down the road. Acclaimed as one of today’s most innovative banjo players, Alison Brown is well-known for leading an ensemble of roots-influenced music. After crossing musical paths for a while, guitarist Scott Macmillan and fiddler Colin Grant sat down to dig into their tunes, arranging and rearranging them in whatever direction they needed to go. Expect some tunes from their award-winning album. The Alt brings together three master Irish traditional musicians in celebration of friendship and song as they make their way through old ballads, winding tunes, and freshly discovered songs. The Alt guitarist John Doyle played on Alison Brown’s most recent album,\nso maybe we’ll get to see them play together in the finale on The Alt’s last night of the Festival.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/roast-pork-in-lower-river/\"   target=\"blank\">Roast Pork in Lower River </a>",

Acclaimed as one of today’s finest progressive banjo players, you rarely find Alison in a conventional bluegrass setting. Instead, she’s known for leading an ensemble that successfully marries a broad array of roots-influenced music including Folk, Jazz, Celtic and Latin. Although banjos typically play “tunes” or “breakdowns,” in Alison Brown’s hands, the banjo truly sings. Brown never wastes a note. Rather than launching into banjo tsunamis, just because she can, Alison stops her precision three-finger roll to leave space for a lyric or other instrumental voice when appropriate. Don’t mistake it, there is plenty of jaw-dropping virtuosity in her playing, but it's always in service to the melody at hand. Brown always plays the words as well as the melody. Also a guitarist, composer, and producer who has won and has been nominated for several Grammy awards, we are excited to welcome Alison and her band back to Celtic Colours.",

He and wife Barbara have recently become the proud owners of Beanie's Bistro in Sherbrooke, NS.\n\nThis return to his roots has also sparked a renewed interest in singing and writing. “Signs of good health,” Max says. This Celtic Colours performance is the first he has ever made in Cape Breton under his own name. Pressure? “No. It's more of a pleasant tingling sensation... with moments of terror.”",

It also serves as a spot to wind down at the end of the day. Performance is by invitation only and depends upon artist availability on any given night. The performance schedule is not posted in advance. North Shore singer-songwriter Buddy MacDonald hosts the nightly festivities.

But get in the door before it’s full, and grab a chair as these multi- talented guitar pickers welcome you\nto their party. J.P. and Dave go way back. J.P. has looked up to Dave and his playing since day one. Both are masters of picking dance tunes on those six strings. The word hero is not one thrown around lightly, but one certainly ascribed to Ray with his fabulous picking. Alison has shared stages with everyone in tonight’s show. Although she’s acclaimed as one of today’s finest progressive banjo players, it’s the guitar she will wield tonight. And Bill Elliott has been known to set the guitar on fire. When he and J.P. start the tunes, watch out for the sparks. And like any good house ceilidh, the good folks of Judique will have the tea on.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/seafood-choices-dinner-2/\"   target=\"blank\">Seafood Choices Dinner</a>",

Although banjos typically play “tunes” or “breakdowns,” in Alison Brown’s hands, the banjo truly sings. Brown never wastes a note. Rather than launching into banjo tsunamis, just because she can, Alison stops her precision three-finger roll to leave space for a lyric or other instrumental voice when appropriate. Don’t mistake it, there is plenty of jaw-dropping virtuosity in her playing, but it's always in service to the melody at hand. Brown always plays the words as well as the melody.

The intimate room invites you in and welcomes you as soon as you walk through the doors. This warmth and closeness provides\na fitting atmosphere for these performers who hold the music so close to their hearts. Newfoundland singer Matthew Byrne won over our hearts when he performed at Celtic Colours in 2015. His repertoire of traditional songs from both sides of the Atlantic transcends time and place as he weaves great stories with beautiful melodies. Gaelic singer and poet Lewis MacKinnon’s performance will leave no question about the\nheart behind his performance. With two fiddles, piano and guitar, MacIsaac & MacKenzie combine Cape Breton piano playing with a modern approach to Celtic fiddle, while Dara Smith-MacDonald and Adam Young take a more traditional approach to the tunes. Your heart will be full after this show tonight.",

His repertoire transcends time and place and his live performance reminds us how\nsatisfying traditional songs can be when stripped down to their basic elements. Matthew Byrne’s music has traveled well beyond the rugged shores of his Newfoundland home since his 2010 debut, <i>Ballads</i>​. Touring as both a solo artist as well as singer with The Dardanelles​, he has graced major festival stages worldwide. With his second album, <i>Hearts & Heroes</i>​, receiving Traditional Recording of the Year​ at the 2015 Canadian Folk Music Awards, Byrne has established himself as one of Canada’s most authentic and vital traditional voices. Matthew releases his highly-anticipated third album, <i>Horizon Lines</i>, in August. This newest collection of traditional material explores a unique repertoire of songs from both sides of the Atlantic and continues Byrne’s journey through his own unique musical lineage.

As a fiddle player, Alexis has performed throughout North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates with acts such as Riverdance, The High Kings, and The Paperboys, while Calum has been fortunate to play with, and accompany, many local Cape Breton artists and international musicians both at home and abroad in the Caribbean and in Scotland on piano and fiddle.\nTheir debut album, The Bay Street Sessions, is a compilation of original and traditional compositions and arrangements, infused with centuries-old feeling and contemporary flair: their mutual love for music articulated in each note and phrase from bow to key.",

They have combined Calum’s Hebridean roots and distinctive Cape Breton piano style with Alexis’ harmonization of Irish, Scottish, and Cape Breton sounds on the fiddle. Through the spirit of their respective approaches to music, they have created a clean and seamless sound that is grounded in tradition. Their debut album, <i>The Bay Street Sessions</i>, is a compilation of original and traditional compositions and arrangements, infused with centuries-old feeling and contemporary flair; their mutual love for music articulated in each note and phrase from bow to key. The duo is joined by John Dahms, a Canadian-based fiddler with a serious commitment to traditional Irish music; and Paul Hawtin, a mostly self-taught guitar-player whose appreciation for early rock & roll and funk took a back seat to traditional music after being exposed to the Irish session scene in early '90s Vancouver.",

        "description_public": "When the Gaels arrived from Scotland, they brought their language and music. The community of Iona is one of the places they settled. Rich in Gaelic heritage, the area has maintained close ties to the roots of its settlers and the Highland Village has played an important role in maintaining that cultural heritage. Renowned Gaelic singer Margaret Stewart comes from the Isle of Lewis. With her passion for the songs and culture of Scotland, she should feel right at home in this setting. Colin Watson is a gifted singer with an impressive repertoire of songs and puirt-a-bheul. The singers will be joined by Hailee LeFort and Cailean MacLean, young artists with deep roots in Cape Breton. Hailee will delight us with her fiddle playing and dance steps, accompanied by Cailean on guitar. There are few places more inspiring for a performance steeped in Gaelic culture and tradition than this little church on the hill.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/iona-roast-pork-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">Iona Roast Pork Dinner</a>",

At that time she took step dance lessons from Melanie Murphy for a few months, and has been picking up steps and dancing ever since. She took fiddle lessons from Chrissy Crowley at just eight years of age. Lessons continued with both Douglas Cameron and Kristen Shaw. Hailee started to take on students of her own at age 15. She has played at various locations in Inverness County such as the Normaway Inn, Margaree Valley, the Family Square Dances in West Mabou and The Cabot Public House in Inverness. Hailee worked at the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre in Judique for the season of 2015 and for the summer of 2016 and is now attending NSCC for business.",

If you close your eyes, you’ll swear she’s lived here her whole life by the sound of her fiddle playing. She just loves Joël’s syncopated piano stylings accompanying her. And Roger Stone, with roots in Richmond County, fills out the slate with guitar, banjo and vocals. Call to order! This show shall be fun.",

She began playing classical violin, and at 17, her Gaelic roots emerged as she delved into the Gaelic culture of Cape Breton and Ireland: language, fiddle, piano, and step dancing. Her store of Gaelic treasures grew through countless kitchen ceilidhs and dances, a Celtic Studies degree, and untold hours with well-worn recordings of great traditional musicians, such as Donald Angus Beaton and John Morris Rankin. She is ever grateful to Willie Kennedy, Morgan MacQuarrie, Buddy MacMaster, Carl MacKenzie, Alexander MacDonnell, and many more tradition bearers for generously sharing their time and gifts with her. Jennifer has performed throughout North America, Scotland, and Ireland, and at dances and ceilidhs in Cape Breton for the last 18 years. Her breadth of experience and enthusiastic love for the tradition make her a dynamic and creative performer and teacher everywhere she goes.",

Rhiannon Giddens, of Grammy winning Carolina Chocolate Drop fame, will astound with her deeply soulful vocals, instrumental prowess on fiddle and banjo, and a little Gaelic puirt-a-bheul to top it all off. Paired with Dirk Powell, no stranger to Celtic Colours, their roots music will reach all the way back to the balcony of our venue tonight. Roots run deep with Fergal Scahill and Ryan Molloy and they’ll be bringing pure drop Irish fiddle intricacy to the stage. First generation Scot and proudly Cape Breton fiddler Mairi Rankin and her harp-playing Outside Track band- mate Ailie Robertson will bring those haunting Scottish melodies to the forefront. Mairi’s best of friends and musical compadres Wendy MacIsaac and Mac Morin will bring the tunes, steps, giggles and smiles that only they can provide.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/apple-glazed-roast-pork-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">Apple Glazed Roast Pork Dinner</a>",

Born in Mabou, Mairi has been influenced by some of the best Cape Breton traditional musicians and instructors on the island. She has developed her own unique style by being immersed in such a rich musical culture. She has toured nationally and internationally as a solo artist, a sideman and is a member of the Cape Breton Celtic super group Beòlach. She has performed with the Rankin Sisters, Unusual Suspects and Bruce Guthro among many others. Mairi has recorded one solo album, two CDs with Beòlach, and has been featured on numerous compilations and recordings. \nAilie Robertson from Edinburgh is widely regarded as one of Scotland’s leading young traditional musicians. She is a musician in the broadest sense: composer, arranger, teacher, improviser and harp virtuoso. Her accomplishment on the clarsach is such that leading Irish flautist Niall Keegan said: “Ailie’s synthesis of Irish, Scottish and contemporary harping technique into an individual style represents the realisation of otherwise unimagined possibilities for the Celtic harp.” Ailie grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was immersed in the harp world from an early age. She began playing the clarsach when she was eleven years old and through her piano and clarsach lessons she developed a love for both classical and traditional music.

A snapshot of tonight’s concert reveals that each of these performers happens to be under the age of 40, yet all have accomplished great things within that relatively short period of time, not the least of which is the mastery of their musical discipline. Hanneke Cassel has worked with the upper echelons of musical royalty and calls Alasdair Fraser and Buddy MacMaster great influences on her playing. That’s evident in her tune selection too. Anita MacDonald and musical partner Ben Miller ensure the combination of fiddle and border pipes continues, with intricate tune selections matched by Gaelic airs sung by Anita. The Celtic roots reach across the sea, too. Paul McKenna is here from Scotland, flying solo tonight to share his own songs and melodies passed down over many generations. It’ll be music suitable for St. Peter himself tonight!\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/ingonish-roast-turkey-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">Ingonish Roast Turkey Dinner</a>",

Hanneke’s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional. A native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community—both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser’s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp, Harald Haugaard’s International Fiddle School, and the Boston Harbor Scottish Fiddle School. She has served as a guest instructor in the American Roots department at Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor of Music in Violin Performance. The Hanneke Cassel Trio features Mike Block on cello and guitarist Keith Murphy.

This fresh and talented duo pairs driving dance-tunes with expressive Gaelic airs and songs, bringing their listeners a powerful combination of passion and grace. Tempering the sharp edge of the pipes and fiddle, Ben and Anita are joined by friends from the Maritimes and beyond, blending subtle and sympathetic rhythm guitar, with the lush, ethereal sounds of the Scottish harp, or the driving groove of Cape Breton-style piano accompaniment, crafting a full and well-rounded sound. Since releasing their debut album, “A Day at the Lake”, to rave reviews in 2015, they have been touring across North America and the United Kingdom. The album was nominated for an East Coast Music Award earlier this year.",

Paul McKenna is at the forefront of this burgeoning genre. A master folk guitarist, his empathy for Scotland and conviction for the characters is spot on in every lyric. Paul has toured the UK, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, Australia, Canada and the USA extensively since 2006. Named Scots Singer of the Year in 2012 at The Scots Traditional Music Awards, Paul’s accolades continue to elevate him and his four albums are full of well-crafted tales of a people who centuries later are still seeking freedom.",

The ties between these lands go back centuries to the Scottish Highland Clearances that were largely responsible for populating many areas of Nova Scotia, and especially Cape Breton Island. When those settlers came, they brought their most prized possesions: their culture, language, dance and music. Acting as a bridge over the Atlantic, this concert features a project examining the music of both sides of the pond--the commonalties, the differences, and the tunes we have shared over those many years. Colin Grant and Ewen Henderson lead this cultural exploration that includes concerts in Cape Breton and in Scotland. This bridge also extends to Scottish, Manx and Irish friends Ímar, also featured on stage tonight. Although their first visit to Celtic Colours, you may recognize Tomas Callister and Adam Rhodes from other bands who have played here before. The tunes that traverse back and forth, old country to new country and back again, will fill the Academy tonight.",

Ewen started learning the fiddle at five years of age and has since then mastered an impressive array of instruments, having had the privilege of learning from many of the true masters of West Highland traditional music - Aonghas Grant Sr. on fiddle most notably - whilst also being influenced by his strong family musical heritage. Though most commonly found performing with Mànran (the band he co-founded in 2010), Ewen has also been fortunate enough to play all over the world with a host of top Scottish and global cross-genre artists including the world-renowned Battlefield Band, with whom he toured for several years, and the World Music pioneers the Afro-Celt Sound System.",

It also serves as a spot to wind down at the end of the day. Performance is by invitation only and depends upon artist availability on any given night. The performance schedule is not posted in advance. North Shore singer-songwriter Buddy MacDonald hosts the nightly festivities.

The river makes its way past the communities of Albert Bridge, Marion Bridge and Mira Gut, then out to Mira Bay. Warm hospitality, good music and good times have always been the way along the river, where sharing songs and playing tunes is tradition. This afternoon will be no different when piano player Tracey Dares MacNeil, who grew up in the Marion Bridge area, will be joined by her daughters The MacNeil Sisters for beautiful Gaelic songs, tunes, and dancing. Matthew Byrne wraps up his all too brief visit in Cape Breton singing songs on the Mira, before heading home to Newfoundland and Labrador. Some traditional tunes from North Sydney fiddler Mike Barron and New Waterford’s Doug MacPhee on piano complete this afternoon visit on the Mira. Make the most of this matinee and take in the scenery along the way.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/lunch-on-the-mira/\"   target=\"blank\">Lunch on the Mira</a>",

His repertoire transcends time and place and his live performance reminds us how\nsatisfying traditional songs can be when stripped down to their basic elements. Matthew Byrne’s music has traveled well beyond the rugged shores of his Newfoundland home since his 2010 debut, <i>Ballads</i>​. Touring as both a solo artist as well as singer with The Dardanelles​, he has graced major festival stages worldwide. With his second album, <i>Hearts & Heroes</i>​, receiving Traditional Recording of the Year​ at the 2015 Canadian Folk Music Awards, Byrne has established himself as one of Canada’s most authentic and vital traditional voices. Matthew releases his highly-anticipated third album, <i>Horizon Lines</i>, in August. This newest collection of traditional material explores a unique repertoire of songs from both sides of the Atlantic and continues Byrne’s journey through his own unique musical lineage. Matthew made his first appearance at Celtic Colours in 2015 and we're looking forward to welcoming him back once again.",

He has toured throughout Canada and internationally and has been recognized with the Order of Canada for his contribution to Cape Breton traditional culture. Doug has lived in Toronto, Boston and even California, but the call of returning home was strong and he is always happiest playing music and living home in New Waterford, Cape Breton.  He has a great recall of tunes and tune names, and an impeccable memory for details of the culture, which made him a perfect employee at the Beaton Institute and archives at Cape Breton University. Doug is now retired but continues to play regularly all around Cape Breton.",

Born in Mabou, Mairi has been influenced by some of the best Cape Breton traditional musicians and instructors on the island. She has developed her own unique style by being immersed in such a rich musical culture. She has toured nationally and internationally as a solo artist, a sideman and is a member of the Cape Breton Celtic super group Beòlach. She has performed with the Rankin Sisters, Unusual Suspects and Bruce Guthro among many others. Mairi has recorded one solo album, two CDs with Beòlach, and has been featured on numerous compilations and recordings. \nAilie Robertson from Edinburgh is widely regarded as one of Scotland’s leading young traditional musicians. She is a musician in the broadest sense: composer, arranger, teacher, improviser and harp virtuoso. Her accomplishment on the clarsach is such that leading Irish flautist Niall Keegan said: “Ailie’s synthesis of Irish, Scottish and contemporary harping technique into an individual style represents the realisation of otherwise unimagined possibilities for the Celtic harp.” Ailie grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was immersed in the harp world from an early age. She began playing the clarsach when she was eleven years old and through her piano and clarsach lessons she developed a love for both classical and traditional music. She has won a plethora of awards for her harp playing.\n\nWinner of Best Group in both the Live Ireland awards and the Tradition In Review awards, the duo are one of the top Celtic acts in the world. With their band The Outside Track, they were Best Live Act nominees in the 2013 MG Alba Scots Traditional Music Awards, and won the German Radio Critics Prize 2014, for their latest album Flash Company. Live Ireland called them, 'Among the top bands in the world - stunning on every cut!'. \nTheir marriage of Celtic music, song and dance has been rapturously received around the world. They blend fiddle, harp, step-dance and vocals with breathtaking vitality. Their blend of boundless energy and unmistakable joie de vivre has won them a large following around the globe.\n(http://haskellopera.com/)",

He’s also the one to provide great “dirt” in his fiddle playing and is well-known for his electric guitar picking and riffs. Two of his greatest musical influences have been Buddy MacMaster from Judique and Arthur Muise from Chéticamp, and we’ll have family and friends of both on hand to play for us tonight. While he won’t be giving out prescriptions, the CBU Honourary Doctor will certainly have the musical medicine for what ails you.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/roast-beef-dinner-at-the-arts-centre/\"   target=\"blank\">Roast Beef Dinner at the Arts Centre</a>",

Kinnon grew up in Mabou, NS, listening to his father Donald Angus (fiddler and composer) and mother (pianist) playing at home as well as playing for dances in the hall across the road. Fiddler and composer Dan R. MacDonald lived behind that hall and frequently visited the Beaton home. Kinnon's good friend, the late John Morris Rankin who was also moved by the same music, also lived nearby.\n\nKinnon has taught workshops at the Celtic Music Center in Judique, NS, at The Ceilidh Trail School of Music in Inverside, Cape Breton, at Fiddle Tunes in Port Townsend, Washington, USA and at Ceòlas in South Uist, Scotland. Kinnon has performed at numerous dances, concerts and festivals throughout Canada, the US, and the UK. He has composed over 700 tunes and published two collection books. Kinnon has appeared on numerous recordings, the first in 1978 Rounder Records released an album titled The Beaton's of Mabou where Donald Angus and Elizabeth were joined by their two sons, Joey (piano) and Kinnon (fiddle). In the eighties Kinnon and his wife Betty released three other recordings, Cape Breton Fiddle 1, Cape Breton Fiddle 2 and Sprig of Ivy which are now available on a compilation CD. A later recording produced by Kinnon was titled Saturday Night Lively where Kinnon and Betty were joined by their daughter Andrea (fiddle) as well as Joey (piano). The next CD, Cape Breton Fiddle and Piano Music from The Beaton Family of Mabou, a Smithsonian Folkways Recording featured Kinnon and his two nephews Rodney MacDonald and Glenn Graham, and Andrea on fiddles and Kinnon's mother Elizabeth, and wife Betty and sister Mary on pianos with dancing by Rodney MacDonald and another daughter Allison. Kinnon's CD called Eoghan Dubh is selections of Kinnon's own compositions.\n\nKinnon is almost always accompanied by his wife Betty, who also comes from a musical family being the sister of the widely known Cape Breton Fiddler, Buddy MacMaster and is the aunt of the widely traveled Natalie MacMaster. For 11 years, Kinnon was also owner/manager of his own Men's Wear Store in Port Hawkesbury, NS. and was the past Executive and Music Director at the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre in Judique, NS.",

Although she has a couple of years of piano training, all her Cape Breton piano playing is done by ear. At 14 years of age, she started playing dances with her brother Buddy MacMaster and has been accompanying fiddlers for dancers ever since. Betty taught at Colaisde na Gàidhlig / the Gaelic College in St. Ann's last summer and has also taught at the Ceilidh Trail School of Music in Inverside Cape Breton, at Fiddle Tunes in Port Townsend in Washington, USA, and Ceolas in South Uist, Scotland. She has played on numerous recordings including the Smithsonian Folkways recording <i>The Beaton Family of Mabou: Cape Breton Fiddle and Piano Music</i> and, most recently, her daughter Andrea's 2016 release <i>Andrea Beaton with Betty and Dave</i>. Betty is most often paired with her husband, fiddler Kinnon Beaton, and the duo is always in demand to play for dances.",

He was exposed at an early age to the singing and storytelling of some of the great singers of his native Island. Much of his songwriting is still influenced by this style that he was so familiar with as a young boy on the North Shore, and his songs have been performed and recorded by artists around the world. Buddy has entertained audiences throughout Canada, the United States, Germany, Scotland and the Scandinavian countries, performing as a solo act and in different combinations with other musicians from Cape Breton including Natalie MacMaster, Howie MacDonald, Ashley MacIsaac, Dave MacIsaac, and John Allan Cameron among many others. Since Celtic Colours started in 1997, Buddy has been the host of the late night Festival Club, and has performed all over the Island with musicians from all over the world including Scotland's Dougie MacLean and Archie Fisher, and Ireland's Tommy Makem and Michael Black. Whether in a small country hall, pub, festival or concert theatre, Buddy's love of writing, singing and entertaining comes across to bridge the gap between performer and listener.",

If you didn’t get to see Alison Brown and her band from Nashville yet, this is your last chance at this year’s Festival. Alison plays banjo, but you rarely find her in a conventional bluegrass setting. The Grammy Award- winning artist has taken her own path, embracing roots-influenced music and delivering it with shades of the folk, jazz, Celtic and Latin traditions. Ímar’s mix of traditional and newly written tunes from Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man fits nicely alongside Cape Breton fiddler and composer Dwayne Côté, while fellow Cape Bretoner J.P. Cormier will be on hand to share his heart-felt songs and dazzle us with his mastery of stringed instruments. And Cherish the Ladies will show us why they have enjoyed more than 30 years of popular and critical acclaim with a selection of tunes on flute, whistles, guitar, mandolin, banjo, accordion, fiddle, and piano. Get your tickets early. You don’t want to miss this one.",

Instead, she’s known for leading an ensemble that successfully marries a broad array of roots-influenced music including Folk, Jazz, Celtic and Latin. Although banjos typically play “tunes” or “breakdowns,” in Alison Brown’s hands, the banjo truly sings. Brown never wastes a note. Rather than launching into banjo tsunamis, just because she can, Alison stops her precision three-finger roll to leave space for a lyric or other instrumental voice when appropriate. Don’t mistake it, there is plenty of jaw-dropping virtuosity in her playing, but it's always in service to the melody at hand. Brown always plays the words as well as the melody. Also a guitarist, composer, and producer who has won and has been nominated for several Grammy awards, we are excited to welcome Alison and her band back to Celtic Colours.",

Acclaimed as one of today’s finest progressive banjo players, you rarely find Alison in a conventional bluegrass setting. Instead, she’s known for leading an ensemble that successfully marries a broad array of roots-influenced music including Folk, Jazz, Celtic and Latin. Although banjos typically play “tunes” or “breakdowns,” in Alison Brown’s hands, the banjo truly sings. Brown never wastes a note. Rather than launching into banjo tsunamis, just because she can, Alison stops her precision three-finger roll to leave space for a lyric or other instrumental voice when appropriate. Don’t mistake it, there is plenty of jaw-dropping virtuosity in her playing, but it's always in service to the melody at hand. Brown always plays the words as well as the melody. Also a guitarist, composer, and producer who has won and has been nominated for several Grammy awards, we are excited to welcome Alison and her band back to Celtic Colours.",

With a line-up featuring members of Mànran, RURA, Talisk and Barrule, and a heavyweight collective haul of top prizes – including the 2016 BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician of the Year, a BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award, nine All-Ireland and eight All-Britain titles – the group’s formation embodies a personal reconnection with its members’ formative years, dating back long before their recent camaraderie around Glasgow’s justly celebrated session scene. Adam Brown (bodhrán), Adam Rhodes (bouzouki), Mohsen Amini (concertina), Ryan Murphy (uilleann pipes) and Tomás Callister (fiddle) share a strong background in Irish music – although only Murphy actually hails from Ireland; Rhodes and Callister are from the Isle of Man, whilst Amini is a Glasgow native, and Brown originally from Suffolk – and it is these foundations which underpin many of Ímar’s distinctive qualities, in both instrumentation and material. Ímar’s unmistakable synergy, however, centres on the overlapping cultural heritage between Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. All three places once shared the same Gaelic language, and a similar, clearly potent, kinship endures between their musical traditions.",

Hometown favourites, singer-singwriter Bruce Guthro and multi-instrumentalist, songwriter Stewart MacNeil, were born and raised in this former mining town. Bruce has travelled the world as a much sought after vocalist, currently fronting the Scottish folk-rock band Runrig, while Stewart delights audiences worldwide through his accordion playing, steps and songs alongside his siblings in The Barra MacNeils. Roots also run deep for fiddling cousins Rodney MacDonald and Glenn Graham, who will share some spirited dance tunes, and Scottish singer Paul McKenna, whose hometown roots may seem pretty far off, will prove to be more familiar than we thought.",

You deserve a little celebration for making it this far and the Inverary Inn in Baddeck is just the place to make it happen. Settle in to the cozy pub atmosphere and get ready for a night of beautifully sung songs, high-energy tunes and maybe a drink or two. Rhiannon Giddens and Dirk Powell’s Appalachian and Cajun-influenced sound combines banjo, fiddle, button accordion, guitar and mandolin for lively tunes and songs from various traditions including Scottish, Irish, Cajun and American Country music. Boston- based fiddler and composer Hanneke Cassel is an exuberant player whose style fuses influences from Cape Breton and the Isle of Skye with Americana grooves. Along with her Trio, Hanneke creates a cutting- edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition. Ben Miller and Anita MacDonald keep the energy up with pipe and fiddle tunes fit for the pub. \n\n19 & Over. Photo ID Required",

Rhiannon Giddens and Dirk Powell are masters of this language. With roots in North Carolina and Kentucky, their musical heritage springs from places where the mix is particularly potent. Rhiannon brought African-American stringband traditions a new and beautiful vitality through The Carolina Chocolate Drops, and has launched a versatile solo career that confirms her status as a major American artist for this day and age. Dirk has championed the Appalachian music of his grandfather and the Cajun/Creole sounds of his Louisiana family since his teenage years, becoming a central figure in the revitalization of both traditions. Both artists have Grammy wins in several contexts, in categories ranging from Folk to Alternative Rock to Blues to Country. Whether with banjos and fiddles, grand pianos framing deeply soulful vocals, or Creole accordions laying down bayou grooves beneath melodies sung in French, the duo’s music may in moments take a path through the mind, or perhaps through dancing feet…. but in the end, they are out to reach hearts, and in each other have found a unique partnership in which to do so.",

Hanneke’s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional. A native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community—both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser’s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp, Harald Haugaard’s International Fiddle School, and the Boston Harbor Scottish Fiddle School. She has served as a guest instructor in the American Roots department at Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor of Music in Violin Performance. The Hanneke Cassel Trio features Mike Block on cello and guitarist Keith Murphy. Fusing influences from the Isle of Skye and Cape Breton with Americana grooves and musical innovations, this group creates a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition.",

This fresh and talented duo pairs driving dance-tunes with expressive Gaelic airs and songs, bringing their listeners a powerful combination of passion and grace. Tempering the sharp edge of the pipes and fiddle, Ben and Anita are joined by friends from the Maritimes and beyond, blending subtle and sympathetic rhythm guitar, with the lush, ethereal sounds of the Scottish harp, or the driving groove of Cape Breton-style piano accompaniment, crafting a full and well-rounded sound. Since releasing their debut album, “A Day at the Lake”, to rave reviews in 2015, they have been touring across North America and the United Kingdom. The album was nominated for an East Coast Music Award earlier this year.",

Mairi Rankin, Mac Morin and Wendy MacIsaac have each benefitted from this traditional transmission of culture as young musicians and performers, and have done their part to pass it on. Margaret Stewart has carried on the traditional Gaelic singing of Scotland’s Isle of Lewis, as a performer and a mentor her whole life. This concert is\nhosted by Comunn Féis Mhàbu, a local organization dedicated to nurturing young traditional musicians and Gaelic singers. It has played a key role in the transmission of the culture\nand Féis Mhàbu Gaelic Singers will represent some of the ongoing results of these efforts in today’s concert, which will also feature Mairi Rankin and her Outside Track bandmate Ailie Robertson on fiddle and harp.

Born in Mabou, Mairi has been influenced by some of the best Cape Breton traditional musicians and instructors on the island. She has developed her own unique style by being immersed in such a rich musical culture. She has toured nationally and internationally as a solo artist, a sideman and is a member of the Cape Breton Celtic super group Beòlach. She has performed with the Rankin Sisters, Unusual Suspects and Bruce Guthro among many others. Mairi has recorded one solo album, two CDs with Beòlach, and has been featured on numerous compilations and recordings. \nAilie Robertson from Edinburgh is widely regarded as one of Scotland’s leading young traditional musicians. She is a musician in the broadest sense: composer, arranger, teacher, improviser and harp virtuoso. Her accomplishment on the clarsach is such that leading Irish flautist Niall Keegan said: “Ailie’s synthesis of Irish, Scottish and contemporary harping technique into an individual style represents the realisation of otherwise unimagined possibilities for the Celtic harp.” Ailie grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was immersed in the harp world from an early age. She began playing the clarsach when she was eleven years old and through her piano and clarsach lessons she developed a love for both classical and traditional music. She has won a plethora of awards for her harp playing.\n\nWinner of Best Group in both the Live Ireland awards and the Tradition In Review awards, the duo are one of the top Celtic acts in the world. With their band The Outside Track, they were Best Live Act nominees in the 2013 MG Alba Scots Traditional Music Awards, and won the German Radio Critics Prize 2014, for their latest album Flash Company. Live Ireland called them, 'Among the top bands in the world - stunning on every cut!'. \nTheir marriage of Celtic music, song and dance has been rapturously received around the world. They blend fiddle, harp, step-dance and vocals with breathtaking vitality. Their blend of boundless energy and unmistakable joie de vivre has won them a large following around the globe.\n(http://haskellopera.com/)",

This Association, made up of amateur as well as professional and well-known players and composers, has been dedicated to preserving and promoting traditional Cape Breton fiddle music since the early 1970s. The Cape Breton Fiddlers’ Association has been the grass roots of the fiddle tradition and the keepers of the Island’s fiddle repertoire, presenting an annual Festival of Cape Breton fiddling, hosting workshops, and providing opportunities for its members to learn new tunes and techniques. Cape Breton fiddle music is alive and flourishing both on the Island and throughout the world, and the Cape Breton Fiddlers’ Association has played a significant role in this resurgence. This afternoon’s concert will showcase various members of the Fiddlers’ Association and a variety of styles and repertoire.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/north-shore-crab-dinner/\"   target=\"blank\">North Shore Crab Dinner</a>",

We’ll catch up with our Artists in Residence, Buddy MacDonald and James Keelaghan, who have something special lined up for us tonight. Rhiannon Giddens and Dirk Powell bring the richest of Cajun and Appalachian folk traditions together, with Rhiannon’s soaring vocals at the forefront. Our next group, Ímar, may be young but these fellas put on quite the show. Their playing will amaze you. Cherish the Ladies are back to delight us one more time with their good humour, impressive playing, and intricate arrangements. And Cape Breton’s travelling troubadour J.P. Cormier will deliver the fast-flying guitar picking you’ve come to expect, with songs that speak from the heart of life here on the Island. With this lineup of singers and players, it’s safe to say we can expect a pretty “grand” finale for this one. And then maybe, just maybe, one last night at the Festival Club? Sure, why not.\n\nNearby Meal: <a href=\"https://celtic-colours.com/workshop/supper-at-the-causeway-homemade-fishcakes-beans/\"   target=\"blank\">Supper at the Causeway: Homemade Fishcakes & Beans</a>",

Their musical range touches on all of what makes American music the resonant force that it is, including fearless original songs written with the conviction to open and heal the wounds of racism and other forms of prejudice that continue to haunt us. They could be seen as possessing a rare multilingualism, but are, in the end, speaking one highly evolved American language; in their performances, audiences are included in a conversation that is spirited, emotional, masterful, and, in the end, transformational.",

Buddy has entertained audiences throughout Canada, the United States, Germany, Scotland and the Scandinavian countries, performing as a solo act and in different combinations with other musicians from Cape Breton including Natalie MacMaster, Howie MacDonald, Ashley MacIsaac, Dave MacIsaac, and John Allan Cameron among many others. Since Celtic Colours started in 1997, Buddy has been the host of the late night Festival Club, and has performed all over the Island with musicians from all over the world including Scotland's Dougie MacLean and Archie Fisher, and Ireland's Tommy Makem and Michael Black.

Located at the Gaelic College in St. Ann's, the licensed Festival Club opens as the evening concerts are closing, offering an opportunity for artists to showcase in a more informal setting, as well as get a session in with friends and colleagues from near and far. It also serves as a spot to wind down at the end of the day. Performance is by invitation only and depends upon artist availability on any given night. The performance schedule is not posted in advance. North Shore singer-songwriter Buddy MacDonald hosts the nightly festivities. Tickets are half price for those holding a ticket stub from a Celtic Colours performance that day.\n<b>*Restricted to 19 years and over. Picture ID required.</b>",
